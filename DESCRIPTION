Description: 
    Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions 
    related to the eigenvalues of large Wishart ("Laguerre Beta Ensemble") 
    matrices.
    .
    The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom densities and distribution
    functions were computed by Momar Dieng's MATLAB package "RMLab", which
    is available on his homepage at 
    http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm 
    .
    This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone, 
    Zongming Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon be
    replaced by a package with more accuracy and built-in support for
    relevant statistical tests.
